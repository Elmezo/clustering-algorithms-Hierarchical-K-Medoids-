### The main goal of this project is to practice and apply clustering algorithms  you have learned (AgglomerativeHierarchical ,K-Medoids Clustering Algorithm) to real-world tasks.Your task is to cluster the dataset into an optimal number of clusters, your steps will be as follows:●Choose your preferred clustering real-world application●Download any suitable datasets from (Kaggle, UCI repository, etc.)●Assess and clean your data if needed( you can use preprocessed data.)●Import the required libraries and perform:1.AgglomerativeHierarchicalClustering Algorithm, find K clusters, using single linkage strategy, considering Euclidean distance as the distance measure.■Visualize your results.2.K-Medoids Clustering Algorithm find K clusters,use the Manhattan distance.■Visualize your results●Conduct a comparison between the 2 Algorithms results.
